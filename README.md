# Hey, I’m Laksamana 👋
I build AI systems that bridge **Data, Models, & Real-World Impact**.

Artificial Intelligence Engineer with 3+ years of experience delivering **LLM/RAG systems, ETL pipelines, and digital twin simulators** across research, clinical, and enterprise environments. Experienced in cross-functional teams, client-facing roles, and production deployment.

Currently pursuing a **Master of Artificial Intelligence at Monash University (GPA 4.0/4.0)**.

## Some things I’ve worked on:
✅ Production-grade **Legal RAG system** for compliance & safety  
🤖 **Digital twin simulators** for autonomous systems & surgical AI research  
📊 Python-based **ETL pipelines** for large-scale structured & unstructured data  
⚙️ End-to-end AI systems (data → model → API → cloud deployment)  
🧠 Machine Learning & LLM applications (NLP, Transformers, RAG, RL)  
🗂️ Database design & querying (SQL, NoSQL, Vector DBs)
